# SmartPower Outlet

Works with: 

* [Samsung SmartPower Outlet](https://shop.smartthings.com/#!/products/smartpower-outlet)

## Modifications

This is my modified version of Samsung's DTH to allow for the configuring of the power reporting feature.
* Show Power Usage (on/off): This stops all power reporting from the device entirely.
* Only show changes over... (number): This let's you set a threshold of change required for the power usage to be logged.
